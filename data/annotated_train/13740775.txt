[BOS] Previous approaches to ensembling diverse models focus on model inputs.
[BOS] Hokamp (2017) shows improvements in the quality estimation task using ensembles of NMT models with multiple input representations which share an output representation.
[BOS] Garmash and Monz (2016) show translation improvements with multi-source-language NMT ensembles.
