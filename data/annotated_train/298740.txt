[BOS] Although the method such as confidence measure can be helpful at some circumstance, our experiment shows that pure character-based tagging (pure CT) can work well with reasonable features and tag set.
[BOS] In (Zhao et al., 2006) , an enhanced CRF tag set is proposed to distinguish different positions in the multi-character words when the word length is less than 6.
[BOS] In this method, feature templates are almost the same as shown in Table 3 with a 3-character window and a 6-tag set {B, B2, B3, M, E, O} is used.
[BOS] Here, tag B and E stand for the first and the last position in a multi-character word, respectively.
[BOS] S stands up a single-character word.
[BOS] B2 and B3 stand for the second and the third position in a multi-character word, whose length is larger than two-character or three-character.
[BOS] M stands for the fourth or more rear position in a multicharacter word, whose length is larger than fourcharacter.

[BOS] In Table 6 , the lines about "pure CT" provide the results generated by pure CT with 6-tag set.
[BOS] We can see from the Table 6 this pure CT approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on all the corpora.
[BOS] On three of the four corpora (AS, MSRA and PKU) this pure CT method gets the best result.
[BOS] Even on IV word, this pure CT approach outperforms Zhang"s CT method and produces comparable results with combination with EIV tags, which shows that pure CT method can perform well on IV words too.
[BOS] Moreover, this character-based tagging approach is more clear and simple than the confidence measure method.

[BOS] Although character-based tagging became mainstream approach in the last two Bakeoffs, it does not mean that word information is valueless in Chinese word segmentation.
[BOS] A word-based perceptron algorithm is proposed recently (Zhang and Clark, 2007) , which views Chinese word segmentation task from a new angle instead of character-based tagging and gets comparable results with the best results of Bakeoff.
[BOS] Table 6 Results of different approach used in our experiments (White background lines are the results we repeat Zhang"s methods and they have some trivial difference with Table 1. )
[BOS] Therefore, the most important thing worth to pay attention in future study is how to integrate linguistic information into the statistical model effectively, no matter character or word information.
