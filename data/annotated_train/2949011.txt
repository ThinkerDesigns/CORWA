[BOS] The use of shallow methods for machine comprehension has been explored in previous work, for example Hirschman et al. (1999) used a bag-ofwords to match question-answer pairs to sentences in the text, and choose the best pair with the best matching sentence.
[BOS] As discussed in our analysis, such systems cannot handle well questions involving negation and quantification.
[BOS] Numerical questions, which we found to be particularly challenging, have been the focus of recent work on algebra word problems (Kushman et al., 2014) for which dedicated systems have been developed.
[BOS] MacCartney et al. (2006) demonstrated that a large set of rules can be used to recognize valid textual entailments.
[BOS] These consider phenomena such as polarity and quantification, similar to those we used in our analysis of the MCTest datasets.
[BOS] More complex methods, which attempt deeper modeling of text include Natural Logic (Angeli and Manning, 2014) and Combinatorial Categorial Grammars (Lewis and Steedman, 2013) combined with distributional models.
[BOS] While promising, these approaches have been developed primarily on sentence-level tasks, thus the stories in MCTest are likely to present additional challenges.

[BOS] The recently proposed class of methods called Memory Network (Weston et al., 2014) , uses neural networks and external memory to answer a simpler comprehension task.
[BOS] Though quite successful on toy tasks, those methods cannot yet be applied to MCTest as they require much larger training datasets than the ones available for this task.

[BOS] A recent approach by Hermann et al. (2015) uses attention-based recurrent neural networks to attack the problem of machine comprehension.
[BOS] In this work, the authors show how to generate large amounts of data for machine comprehension exploiting news websites, and how to use novel architectures in deep learning to solve the task.
[BOS] However, due to the need for a large dataset for training, and the focus only on questions that take entities as answers, this approach has not been applied to MCTest.
