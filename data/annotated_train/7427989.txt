[BOS] In machine translation, some efforts have been made to improve rule coverage and advance the performance of syntax-based systems.
[BOS] For example, Galley et al. (2006) proposed the idea of rule composing which composes two or more rules with shared states to form a larger, composed rule.
[BOS] Their experimental results showed that the rule composing method could significantly improve the translation accuracy of their syntax-based system.
[BOS] Following Galley et al. (2006) 's work, proposed SPMT models to improve the coverage of phrasal rules, and demonstrated that the system performance could be further improved by using their proposed models.
[BOS] described a binarization method that binarized parse trees to improve the rule coverage on nonsyntactic mappings.
[BOS] DeNeefe et al. (2007) analyized the phrasal coverage problem, and compared the phrasal coverage as well as translation accuracy for various rule extraction methods (Galley et al., 2006; .

[BOS] As another research direction, some work is focused on enlarging the scope of rule extraction to improve rule coverage.
[BOS] For example, (Venugopal et al., 2008) and (Mi and Huang, 2008) extracted rules from the k-best parses and forest generated by a single parser to alleviate the problem of the limited scope of 1-best parse, and achieved promising results.

[BOS] Our work differs from previous work in that we are concerned with obtaining diversified translation rules using multiple different parsers (or parsing models) instead of a single parser (or parsing model).
[BOS] It can be regarded as an enhancement of previous studies.
[BOS] As shown in the following parts of this paper, it works very well with the existing techniques, such as rule composing (Galley et al., 2006) , SPMT models and rule extraction with kbest parses (Venugopal et al., 2008) .
