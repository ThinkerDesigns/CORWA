[BOS] Compared to the traditional slot-filling based dialog (Williams and Young, 2007; Wen et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2017) , end-to-end training methods (e.g., (Bordes and Weston, 2017) , this work) do not require handcrafted state representations and their corresponding annotations in each dialog.
[BOS] Thus, they can easily be adapted to a new domain.
[BOS] We discuss end-to-end approaches along two verticals: 1) decoder: whether the response is retrieved or generated and 2) encoder: how the dialog history and KB tuples are encoded.
[BOS] T1 T2 T3  T4  T5  T1  T2  T3 T4 T5 Table 6 : Ablation study: impact of each model element on BOSSNET Most of the existing end-to-end approaches retrieve a response from a pre-defined set (Bordes and Weston, 2017; Liu and Perez, 2017; Seo et al., 2017) .
[BOS] These methods are generally successful when they have to provide boilerplate responsesthey cannot construct responses by using words in KB not seen during training.
[BOS] Alternatively, generative approaches are used where the response is generated one word at a time Madotto et al., 2018) .
[BOS] These approaches mitigate the unseen entity problem by incorporating the ability to copy words from the input (Vinyals et al., 2015; Gu et al., 2016) .
[BOS] The copy mechanism has also found success in summarization See et al., 2017) and machine translation .
[BOS] BOSSNET is also a copy incorporated generative approach.

[BOS] For encoding, some approaches represent the dialog history as a sequence .
[BOS] Unfortunately, using a single long sequence for encoding also enforces an order over the set of KB tuples making it harder to perform inferencing over them.
[BOS] Other approaches represent the dialog context as a bag.

[BOS] sys-1 yes sure .
[BOS] there is only on italian restaurant called pizza hut fen ditton in the east .
[BOS] what else do you want to know ?
[BOS] usr-2 what is their address please ?

[BOS] Gold the address for pizza hut fen ditton is cambridge retail park newmarket road fen ditton .
[BOS] can i help you with anything else ?
