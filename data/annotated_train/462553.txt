[BOS] Our work is related to the following research topics on NMT:

[BOS] Generating phrases for NMT In these studies, the generated NMT multi-word phrases are either from an SMT model or a bilingual dictionary.
[BOS] In syntactically guided neural machine translation (SGNMT), the NMT decoder uses phrase translations produced by the hierarchical phrasebased SMT system Hiero, as hard decoding constraints.
[BOS] In this way, syntactic phrases are generated by the NMT decoder (Stahlberg et al., 2016b) .
[BOS] Zhang and Zong (2016) use an SMT translation system, which is integrated an additional bilingual dictionary, to synthesize pseudo-parallel sentences and feed the sentences into the training of NMT in order to translate low-frequency words or phrases.
[BOS] Tang et al. (2016) propose an external phrase memory that stores phrase pairs in symbolic forms for NMT.
[BOS] During decoding, the NMT decoder enquires the phrase memory and properly generates phrase translations.
[BOS] The significant differences between these efforts and ours are 1) that we dynamically generate phrase translations via an SMT model, and 2) that at the same time we modify the encoder to incorporate structural information to enhance the capability of NMT in phrase translation.
