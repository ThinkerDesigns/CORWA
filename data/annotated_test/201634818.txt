[BOS] The accuracy of NN models improves as the model sizes and data increases.
[BOS] Thus, it is necessary to use multiple GPUs when training NN models within a short turnaround time.

[BOS] There are two common approaches for using multiple GPUs in training.
[BOS] One is data parallelism, involving sending different data to different GPUs with the replicas of the same model.
[BOS] The other is model parallelism, involving sending the same data to different GPUs having different parts of the model.
