[BOS] (Rush et al., 2015; Nallapati et al., 2016; See et al., 2017; Chen and Bansal, 2018) generates summaries word-by-word after digesting the main content of the document.
[BOS] Outof-vocabulary(OOV), repetition, and saliency are three conspicuous problems need to be well solved in abstractive document summarization.
[BOS] Some works (Nallapati et al., 2016; See et al., 2017; Paulus et al., 2018) handle the OOV problem by introducing the pointer network.
[BOS] See et al. (2017) introduces a coverage mechanism, which is a variant of the coverage vector (Tu et al., 2016) from Neural Machine Translation, to eliminate repetitions.
[BOS] However, there are just a few studies on saliency problem (Tan et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2018; Gehrmann et al., 2018) .
[BOS] To obtain more salient in-formation, Chen et al. (2016) proposes a new attention mechanism to distract them in the decoding step to better grasp the overall meaning of input documents.
[BOS] We optimize attention using an attention refinement unit under the novel variance loss supervision.
[BOS] As far as we know, we are the first to propose explicit losses to refine the attention model in abstractive document summarization tasks.
[BOS] Recently many models (Paulus et al., 2018; Celikyilmaz et al., 2018; Chen and Bansal, 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Jiang and Bansal, 2018) have emerged taking advantage of reinforcement learning (RL) to solve the discrepancy issue in seq2seq model and have yielded the state-of-the-art performance.
