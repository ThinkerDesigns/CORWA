[BOS] Inter-sentence RE is a recently introduced task.
[BOS] Peng et al. (2017) and Song et al. (2018) used graph-based LSTM networks for n-ary RE in multiple sentences for protein-drug-disease associations.
[BOS] They restricted the relation candidates in up to two-span sentences.
[BOS] Verga et al. (2018) considered multi-instance learning for document-level RE.
[BOS] Our work is different from Verga et al. (2018) in that we replace Transformer with a GCNN model for full-abstract encoding using non-local dependencies such as entity coreference.

[BOS] GCNN was firstly proposed by Kipf and Welling (2017) and applied on citation networks and knowledge graph datasets.
[BOS] It was later used for semantic role labelling (Marcheggiani and Titov, 2017), multi-document summarization (Yasunaga et al., 2017) and temporal relation extraction (Vashishth et al., 2018) .
[BOS] Zhang et al. (2018) used a GCNN on a dependency tree for intrasentence RE.
[BOS] Unlike previous work, we introduced a GCNN on a document-level graph, with both intra-and inter-sentence dependencies for intersentence RE.
