[BOS] Neural response generation models are built upon the encoder-decoder framework (Sutskever et al., 2014) .
[BOS] Starting from the basic sequence-tosequence with attention architecture (Vinyals and Le, 2015; Shang et al., 2015) , extensions under the framework have been made to combat the "safe response" problem (Mou et al., 2016; Tao et al., 2018) ; to model the hierarchy of conversation history (Serban et al., 2016 (Serban et al., , 2017 Xing et al., 2018) ; to generate responses with specific personas or emotions ; and to speed up response decoding .
[BOS] In this work, we also aim to tackle the "safe response" problem, but in an explainable, controllable, and general way.
[BOS] Rather than learning with a different objective (e.g., ), generation from latent variables (e.g., ), or introducing extra content (e.g., ), we explicitly describe relationship between message-response pairs by defining metawords and express the meta-words in responses through a goal tracking memory network.
[BOS] Our method allows developers to manipulate the generation process by playing with the meta-words and provides a general solution to response generation with specific attributes such as dialogue acts.

[BOS] Recently, controlling specific aspects in text generation is drawing increasing attention (Hu et al., 2017; Logeswaran et al., 2018) .
[BOS] In the context of dialogue generation, Wang et al. (2017) propose steering response style and topic with human provided topic hints and fine-tuning on small scenting data; Zhang et al. (2018a) propose learning to control specificity of responses; and very recently, See et al. (2019) investigate how controllable attributes of responses affect human engagement with methods of conditional training and weighted decoding.
[BOS] Our work is different in that (1) rather than playing with a single variable like specificity or topics, our model simultaneously controls multiple variables and can take controlling with specificity or topics as special cases; and (2) we manage attribute expression in response generation with a principled approach rather than simple heuristics like in (See et al., 2019) , and thus, our model can achieve better accuracy in terms of attribute expression in generated responses.
