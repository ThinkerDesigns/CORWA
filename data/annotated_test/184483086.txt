[BOS] We were guided by the work of (Zhang et al., 2018) who used a CNN+GRU based approach for a similar task.
[BOS] We use an approach which was influenced by this work but used an LSTM based approach.

[BOS] A proposal of typology of abusive language sub-tasks is presented in (Waseem et al., 2017) .
[BOS] For studies on languages other than English see (Su et al., 2017) on Chinese and (Fier et al., 2017) on Slovene.
