[BOS] Leveraging parallels between UCCA and known approaches for syntactic parsing, Hershcovich et al. (2017) proposed TUPA, a customized transition-based parser with dense feature representation.
[BOS] Based on this model, Hershcovich et al. (2018a) used multitask learning effectively by training a UCCA model along with similar parsing tasks where more training data is available, such as Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) (Banarescu et al., 2013) and Universal Dependencies (UD) (Nivre et al., 2016) .
[BOS] Due to the requirements of reentrancy, discontinuity, and non-terminals, other powerful parsers were shown to be less suitable for parsing with UCCA (Hershcovich et al., 2017) .
